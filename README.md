# [Project1: Fake Reviews Detection](https://github.com/PragnyaPataskar/fake_review_detection)
This is part of my master's thesis project, where the main aim was to check whether we can extract context-rich features using Large Language Models (LLMs). 

* Where the data was scraped from the E-commerce site, such as Amazon, Otto, and Trustpilot.
* As the main idea was all about feature extraction so for a better analysis of the result, the features were extracted both with the traditional way using NLP techniques and with Large Language Models using concepts like prompt engineering, using OpenAI's gpt models, Langchain custom tools, and agents.
* After the extracted features, the models used for training were Machine Learning Models (Supervised Models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
* The results obtained after training the models with both features, traditional features and LLM-extracted features, are compared using Evaluation Metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value.
* The results show that traditional features perform well in determining fake reviews compared to LLM-extracted features.
